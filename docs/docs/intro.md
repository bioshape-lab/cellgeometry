# Getting Started

## üìù Project Description 

This project focuses on the analysis and comparison of biological cell shapes using elastic metrics implemented in Geomstats. The shapes of biological cells are determined by various processes and biophysical forces, which play a crucial role in cellular functions. By utilizing quantitative measures that reflect cellular morphology, this project aims to leverage large-scale biological cell image data for morphological studies.

The analysis of cell shapes has significant applications in various domains. One notable application is the accurate classification and discrimination of cancer cell lines treated with different drugs. Measures of irregularity and spreading of cells can provide valuable insights for understanding the effects of drug treatments.
