## üìù Project Description 

This project focuses on the analysis and comparison of biological cell shapes using elastic metrics implemented in Geomstats. The shapes of biological cells are determined by various processes and biophysical forces, which play a crucial role in cellular functions. By utilizing quantitative measures that reflect cellular morphology, this project aims to leverage large-scale biological cell image data for morphological studies.

The analysis of cell shapes has significant applications in various domains. One notable application is the accurate classification and discrimination of cancer cell lines treated with different drugs. Measures of irregularity and spreading of cells can provide valuable insights for understanding the effects of drug treatments.

## üéØ Features

- Quantitative analysis and comparison of biological cell shapes using Geomstats.
- Utilization of elastic metrics implemented in Geomstats for shape analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install and set up the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone bioshape-lab/cells
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cells/cells/streamlit
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, resolves dependencies, and installs them into the virtual environment.

6. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Hello.py
   ```

   The Streamlit app should now be running locally. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

> __Note:__ Make sure you have Python and Poetry installed on your machine before following these steps. The `pyproject.yaml` file should contain the necessary dependencies and their versions, enabling Poetry to manage the installation process effectively.


## üöÄ Usage

     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Hello.py
   ```

4. Once the app is running, it will display a local URL, such as `http://localhost:8501`.

5. Open your web browser and visit the provided URL to access the Streamlit app.

6. Interact with the app's user interface to explore and analyze the biological cell shapes.

7. Customize the parameters, select different options, or upload your own data to observe the impact on the analysis and visualization of cell shapes.

8. View the results and visualizations presented by the app, which may include statistical summaries, plots, or interactive displays.

9. Experiment with different features and functionalities of the app to gain insights into the morphological characteristics of the cells.

10. To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt where it is running.

### Q4: How do I manage project dependencies with Poetry?

A4: Poetry provides a simple and intuitive way to manage project dependencies. You can define your project's dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file using the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section. Poetry handles dependency resolution and installation automatically when you run `poetry install`. You can also manage additional dependencies such as development and testing packages.

### Q5: Can I use other package managers with Streamlit?

A5: Yes, you can use other package managers like pip or conda with Streamlit. Streamlit is compatible with different package management systems, and you can use your preferred package manager to install and manage dependencies. However, if you're using Poetry for your project, it is recommended to stick with it for consistency and to ensure proper management of dependencies.

### Q6: How do I deploy my Streamlit app with Poetry?

A6: Deploying a Streamlit app with Poetry involves a few steps. First, ensure you have a proper deployment environment set up, such as a cloud-based service or hosting platform. Then, create a deployment configuration file, such as a `Dockerfile`, that includes the necessary instructions to install project dependencies using Poetry. Finally, follow the deployment instructions provided by your hosting platform to deploy your Streamlit app with the required dependencies.

### Q7: How do I update my project dependencies with Poetry?

A7: To update your project dependencies using Poetry, you can run `poetry update` command. This command updates your project's dependencies to their latest compatible versions as specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. Poetry resolves and installs the updated dependencies automatically, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

### Q8: Can I share my Poetry-based Streamlit app with others?

A8: Yes, you can share your Poetry-based Streamlit app with others. Ensure that you include the necessary files, such as the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`, which contain the dependency information. You can also provide instructions on how to set up and run the app, including the steps to install Poetry and run `poetry install` to install the dependencies.

### Q9: Where can I find more information about Poetry?

A9: You can find more information about Poetry, including detailed documentation and examples, on the official Poetry website: [python-poetry.org](https://python-poetry.org/). The documentation provides in-depth guidance on various aspects of using Poetry for package management.
